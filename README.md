# TODO

-Difference between kqgreedy_replay and kqlearning_replay

# Available Algorithms

- Kernel Q-Learning with:
-Discrete State/Actions
- Cont. State /Discrete Actions
- Cont. State and Actions

- Kernel Normalized Advantage Functions for Continuous State/Action Spaces

# To run:
Kernel-NAF with Continuous Mountain Car
`python rlcore.py cfg/knaf_mcar.cfg`

# Tuning parameters:
To tune learning rates and other parameters, adjust the corresponding parameters in the .cfg file.
